# Aleutian Local v0.3.0 - The "Secure Agent" Release

**Date:** December 6, 2025
**Status:** Beta (Stable for Local Development)
**Focus:** Security, Governance, and Autonomous Agents

## Major Enhancement
This release marks the transition of Aleutian from a passive RAG chatbot to an **Active, Policy-Enforced Agentic Platform**. We have successfully implemented a "Data Loss Prevention (DLP) Firewall" that sits between the developer and the LLM, enabling secure local coding assistance.

## Key Features

### 1. The Policy Engine (The "Firewall")
* **Immutable Rules:** Security policies (`data_classification_patterns.yaml`) are now **compiled into the binary**. They cannot be disabled by deleting a config file.
* **Secure Ingestion:** `aleutian populate` now pre-scans every file for Secrets (API Keys) and PII before it ever touches the Vector DB.
* **Active Chat Protection:** `aleutian chat` and `trace` scan user inputs in real-time, blocking requests that contain sensitive patterns before they leave the orchestrator.
* **Audit Logging:** Every approved or blocked action is logged to `scan_audit_log.jsonl` for compliance review.

### 2. Autonomous Agent (`aleutian trace`)
* **"Claude Code" Experience:** A new CLI command that allows an LLM to actively explore your local codebase.
* **Tool Use:** The agent can `list_files` and `read_file` to understand context dynamically.
* **Local Intelligence:** Optimized for **Qwen2.5-Coder** and **GPT-OSS**, providing SOTA reasoning on consumer hardware (Mac M2/M3).

### 3. Developer Experience (DX)
* **Smart CLI:** The `aleutian` binary now detects if it is running in a "Dev Environment" (source code present) vs "User Mode" (installed via Brew), adjusting file paths automatically.
* **Visual Feedback:** New real-time spinner with **Resource Monitoring** (CPU/RAM usage) during agent thoughts.
* **Self-Healing Stack:** `aleutian stack start` can now detect broken Podman VM mounts (common on macOS) and perform a "Factory Reset" on the infrastructure to recover automatically.

## Technical Improvements
* **Manual Profile:** Added `--profile manual` to prevent auto-optimization from overriding custom model selections in `override.yml`.
* **Force Rebuild:** Added `--build` flag to easily update containers during development.
* **Secrets Management:** Interactive, secure prompt for API keys (HuggingFace/OpenAI) that handles paste buffers and prevents 0-byte errors.
* **Backend Agnostic:** Unified interface for switching between Ollama (Local) and Cloud providers.

## Known Limitations (Roadmap v0.4.0)
1.  **Agent is RAG-Blind:** The `trace` agent currently uses file-system tools only. It does not yet query the Weaviate Vector DB for semantic context.
2.  **Single-Direction DLP:** The Policy Engine currently scans Inputs (Prompts). Output scanning (LLM responses) is scheduled for the next release.
3.  **Container Isolation:** The agent requires volume mounting (`-v .:/app/codebase`) to see files. v0.4.0 will move to a "Client-Side Tool" architecture where the CLI handles file access, ensuring perfect air-gapping.

## Upgrade Instructions
1.  **Recompile CLI:** `go build -o aleutian ./cmd/aleutian`
2.  **Update Config:** Ensure `podman-compose.override.yml` points to `qwen2.5-coder:14b`.
3.  **Restart:** `./aleutian stack start --profile manual --build`
