# Skeptic Few-Shot Examples Configuration
#
# This file defines custom few-shot examples for the skeptic audit in the
# verified RAG pipeline. These examples teach the LLM how to identify
# hallucinations vs. verified claims.
#
# To use this file:
#   1. Set environment variable: VERIFIED_SKEPTIC_EXAMPLES_PATH=/path/to/this/file.yaml
#   2. Or pass in config: {"skeptic_examples_path": "/path/to/this/file.yaml"}
#
# Each example must have these fields:
#   - type: "verified" or "hallucination"
#   - query: The user's original question
#   - answer: The LLM's proposed answer to audit
#   - evidence: The source documents (formatted as [Source N]: content)
#   - output: The expected JSON output from the skeptic
#
# Tips for good examples:
#   - Include domain-specific examples for your use case
#   - Balance verified and hallucination examples (50/50 is good)
#   - Show subtle hallucinations (not just obvious lies)
#   - Use real-world formatting from your documents

examples:
  # Example 1: A fully verified answer
  - type: verified
    query: "What is the capital of France?"
    answer: "Paris is the capital of France [Source 0]."
    evidence: "[Source 0]: France is a country in Western Europe. Its capital city is Paris."
    output:
      is_verified: true
      reasoning: "The claim that Paris is the capital of France is directly stated in Source 0."
      hallucinations: []
      missing_evidence: []

  # Example 2: Partial hallucination (some claims lack evidence)
  - type: hallucination
    query: "Tell me about Python programming."
    answer: "Python was created by Guido van Rossum in 1991. It is the most popular programming language in the world and is used by over 10 million developers."
    evidence: "[Source 0]: Python is a programming language created by Guido van Rossum. It was first released in 1991."
    output:
      is_verified: false
      reasoning: "While Source 0 confirms the creator and release year, two claims lack evidence: (1) 'most popular programming language' and (2) '10 million developers'. These statistics are not in the sources."
      hallucinations:
        - "Python is the most popular programming language in the world"
        - "Python is used by over 10 million developers"
      missing_evidence:
        - "Statistics on Python's popularity ranking"
        - "Developer usage numbers"

  # Example 3: Verified with multiple sources
  - type: verified
    query: "What are the key features of React?"
    answer: "React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces [Source 0]. It uses a virtual DOM for performance [Source 1]."
    evidence: |
      [Source 0]: React is a free and open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on components.
      [Source 1]: React uses a virtual DOM to minimize direct manipulation of the actual DOM, improving performance.
    output:
      is_verified: true
      reasoning: "Both claims are directly supported. Source 0 confirms React is a JS library for UIs. Source 1 confirms the virtual DOM for performance."
      hallucinations: []
      missing_evidence: []

  # Example 4: Inference-based hallucination (connecting dots without evidence)
  - type: hallucination
    query: "Is the new product successful?"
    answer: "The new product is very successful. Sales increased by 50% and customer satisfaction is at an all-time high."
    evidence: "[Source 0]: Q3 sales report shows a 50% increase in unit sales compared to Q2."
    output:
      is_verified: false
      reasoning: "Source 0 confirms the 50% sales increase, but 'very successful' is subjective interpretation and 'customer satisfaction at all-time high' has no evidence."
      hallucinations:
        - "The new product is very successful (subjective claim)"
        - "Customer satisfaction is at an all-time high"
      missing_evidence:
        - "Customer satisfaction metrics"
        - "Definition of 'successful' criteria"
